# Solutions to problems using Magento 2.

* Problem: CSS files not being found.  
  Solution: Run the following command: `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy`.  

* Problem: `Error: Cannot instantiate interface Magento\Framework\App\Config\Scope\ReaderPoolInterface` or similar message.  
  Solution: If you have not installed the Magento application yet, install it with `setup:install`. If the Magento application has been installed try clearing caches and `/var/generation` and `/var/di` directories. If you are making changes to php classes you will often need to clear the `/var/generation` directory in order for autogenerated files to be created.
